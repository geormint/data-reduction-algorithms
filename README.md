This is my thesis for my bachelor degree with title Data Reduction Techniques. The code is written in Python. I tested different distance metrics to find which one offers the best data reduction. I implemented two algorithms, the Edited Nearest Neighbor and the Condensed Nearest Neighbor. After I got the results from these two algorithms I run the K-Nearest Neighobor to see which algorithm gets better accuracy.
