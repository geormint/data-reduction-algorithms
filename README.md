This is my thesis for my bachelor degree in Computer Science with title <code>Study of the effect of metric distance in data reduction techniques for the K nearest neighbors classifier</code>. 

I used Python for the development of the algorithms. I tested different distance metrics to find which one offers the most reduction percentage across multiple datasets that I found on the <a href="https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/datasets.php">KEEL</a> respository. I implemented two algorithms, the <code>Edited Nearest Neighbor</code> and the <code>Condensed Nearest Neighbor</code>. After I got the new datasets from these two algorithms I run the K-Nearest Neighobor on them to see which distance metric and algorithm has the best accuracy.
